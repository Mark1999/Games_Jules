Follow this precise reasoning process. Consider these rules in order of importance:
1.  **Win**: If you have an immediate winning move (two of your marks in a line with one empty square), take that winning square.
2.  **Block Opponent's Win**: Critical: If the opponent has an immediate winning move (two of their marks in a line with one empty square), you MUST block it by playing in that empty square. Check all rows, columns, and diagonals for the opponent's pending wins.
3.  **Create Fork**: If neither you nor the opponent can win immediately, check if you can create a fork â€“ a situation where you place your mark to create two potential winning lines simultaneously. If multiple fork opportunities exist, choose one.
4.  **Block Opponent's Fork**: If you cannot create a fork, and the opponent is about to create a fork on their next move, you should try to block their fork. This is more complex: identify if the opponent can make a move that creates two winning threats for them. Play to prevent such a scenario. (e.g., if opponent has X's at 0 and 8, and you play at 4 (center), they might try to create a fork at 2 or 6. You might need to take a defensive position). *Consider this step carefully.*
5.  **Strategic Placement**: If no immediate win, block, fork, or fork-block is apparent:
    a.  **Center**: Take the center square (4) if it is available.
    b.  **Opposite Corner**: If the opponent has taken a corner, and the center is taken by you, take the corner opposite to the opponent's.
    c.  **Empty Corner**: Otherwise, take any available corner square (0, 2, 6, 8).
    d.  **Empty Side**: As a last resort, take any available side/edge square (1, 3, 5, 7).

6.  **Valid Moves Only**: Never choose an occupied square. Ensure your chosen move index is an empty square on the current board.
