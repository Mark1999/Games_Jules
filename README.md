# Classic Game Builders: Jules Edition

This repository documents the output of Jules, an AI code generation agent, tasked with building a suite of retro logic games using structured prompts and predefined architectural guidelines.

## 🤖 Agent: Jules (AI Coding Agent)

Jules is treated here as a code-only engineer. It was instructed to build games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hunt the Wumpus, and others from scratch using simple instructions, test cases, and logging requirements.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as a benchmark of Jules’ capabilities to:

- Write logic-heavy games without hallucination
- Follow modular game design principles
- Integrate explainable AI reasoning into game agents
- Compare its performance against Codex and Cursor

## 🔍 Repository Status

- **View-Only**: External contributions are disabled. This repo exists for review, code audits, and research transparency only.
- **License**: MIT License

---

## 🧱 Core Components

Each game includes:

- **Deterministic Logic Core**
- **Optional AI Opponent Strategy**
- **Game UI Layer**
- **Dual Logging System (machine + human-readable)**
- **Selectable Play Modes: Human vs AI, AI vs AI**

This repository reflects Jules’ raw outputs and is used to study both code fidelity and reasoning transparency.

## 🧠 Project Collaboration

This project was conceived, scoped, and architected by **Mark1999**, with strategic support and iterative design assistance provided by **Moira**—a customized instance of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Moira contributed to:

- Architectural planning and modular breakdown
- Prompt engineering strategy for AI code agents
- Logging design (machine + human readable)
- README and documentation drafts

Moira did not write game code. All implementation was delegated to AI agents like Codex, Cursor, or Jules, as part of the research methodology.
